# HomeSim
Terminal Based **Smart Home Simulator** made in [C++](https://cplusplus.com) and [PDcurses](https://pdcurses.org) for the User Interface.

<br>

## Features 📑
**Smart Home simulation controlled by interconnected home automation components.**

The simulator includes **Zones** within the **Home**, each with Properties such as *temperature*, *light*, *etc*. These **Properties** are monitored by **Sensors**, feeding data to **Processors** that will take actions based on **Rules** determined by the user and the *readings*.

The simulator is controlled by commands written by the user.

<br>

## How to Use 🛠
You'll need **PDcurses** installed on your system and to configure **CLion**

* **PDcurses** : 
[https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses/releases](https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses/releases)

* **CLion Configuration** : // link para o ficheiro pdf

<br>

## Commands 💻
> `<xxx>` refers to a value (number or text), and the characters < and > are not part of what should be written.<br>
`<x | y | z>` indicates that only one of x, y, or z should be specified (again, without the <>).<br>
`[v]` indicates that the parameter v is optional, and the characters [ and ] should not be written.
